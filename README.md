# Rusty18n
A pretty simple yet robust library to deal with i18n on Rust.

# Why Rusty18n?
So, imagine you have an application, lets say a discord bot (yeah, that was my use case).
I was looking for a simple way to just write i18n resources and use then as i wish, but
the majority of already stablished solutions required to use yml files, or running something
at the background. Yes, I am picky, i didn't want that, so i built my own basic solution
that covers up for my use case. Here every i18n resource is done through code alone, so
things should be familiar.

# So how do i start?
Yeah... i still need to publish this package, so you figure it out yourself!

# But how do i use it?
You can see an example [here](https://github.com/o-dasher/rusty18n/tree/master/example)
