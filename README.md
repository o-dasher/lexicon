# Rusty18n
A pretty simple yet robust library to deal with i18n on Rust.

# Why Rusty18n?
Wouldn't it be pretty useful and handy if you could write all your translations directly in your
source code? This is what this crate is solving. I was in need of a simple and easy to use i18n
solution for my discord bot, and I had the idea to create a simple in-memory i18n handler. It
provides all the basis for what you would expect for an in-memory i18n in Rust, covering simple
static translations to dynamic ones.

# So how do i start?
You just `cargo add rusty18n`. Yeah, simple as that.
You can see an example usage [here](https://github.com/o-dasher/rusty18n/tree/master/example)
